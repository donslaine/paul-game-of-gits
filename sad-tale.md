House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

Ned organizes a coup against the Lannisters and has Joffrey murdered, then abdicates his throne to Robb Stark, his son, who rules over the seven kingdoms with a heavy but just hand.
